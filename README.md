This repository contains the gerber and KiCad files to make a custom PCB for lab 6. Using the outline below, as well as the associated resources and references, I created the PCB to connect a DS1722 chip to a MikroBUS standard port. Our E155 protoboard has one such port. The DS1722 is a digital thermometer which communicates over the popular SPI interface. I elected to maintain the standard form factor of the MikroBUS standard, minus the notch, but chose to only include the silkscreen markings which I felt were most relevant.
